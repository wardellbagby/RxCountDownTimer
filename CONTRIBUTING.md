# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the changes you wish to make via an issue. 

## Pull Request Process

Only project collaborators are allowed to directly merge. All PRs not created by a collaborator will be merged by a collaborator.

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a 
   build.
2. Update the [README.md](README.md) if your Pull Request would make any information located on it out of date.
3. Squash your commits into 1 commit before creating a pull request. 
4. Create your pull request and point it at the master branch.
5. Any failing pull request checks must be fixed before a pull request will be merged, unless approval by a collaborator is given.
